    "Name": "CockroachDB",

    "Description": "CockroachDB is a scalable, fault-tolerant, SQL database built on a transactional and strongly-consistent key-value store. It is backed by RocksDB and uses distributed consensus algorithm to ensure consistency, it is inspired by Spanner wait commit to implement serializable. It is currently in beta. (Because CockroachDB is rapidly changing, so many findings are based on design document, outdated documentation or available code.)",

    "System Architecture Options": [
        "Shared-Nothing"
    ],
    "System Architecture Description": "CockroachDB has two layers, the SQL layer and the storage layer. The SQL layer sits on top of the transactional and strongly-consistent distributed key-value store. In the key-value store, the key ranges are divided and stored in RocksDB and replicated across cluster. It exports structured data API of relational concepts. It exports standard SQL interface at the SQL layer. The SQL layer translates SQL statements into calls to structured data API.",
